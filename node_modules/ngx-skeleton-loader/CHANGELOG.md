## [2.1.0][] - 2020-06-01

### Updated

- Upgrading @angular/cli to version 9
- ðŸŽ‰ Decreasing bundle size to 1.17KB ðŸŽ‰

## [2.0.0][] - 2020-05-15

### Updated

- Upgrading NodeJS to v12.16.2
- Updating documentation with `animation` attribute

### Added

- Supporting for new animation `progress-dark` to enable users when using theme with darker color schema
- Supporting for different animations ðŸŽ‰

Now we can define the animation we want to use in `<ngx-skeleton-loader>` component via `animation` input. It's a string that can defined the animation used during the loading, having as options:

- `false`: it will disable the animation;
- `progress` - _default_: it will use it `progress` as animation;
- `pulse`: it will use `pulse` as animation;

> `progress` is the default animation, used as the single one previously. If you don't pass the animation attribute, it defaults to `progress`.

```html
<div class="item">
  <!-- Disables the animation -->
  <ngx-skeleton-loader animation="false"></ngx-skeleton-loader>
  <!-- Uses `progress` as animation -->
  <ngx-skeleton-loader animation="progress"></ngx-skeleton-loader>
  <ngx-skeleton-loader></ngx-skeleton-loader>
  <!-- Uses `pulse` as animation -->
  <ngx-skeleton-loader animation="pulse"></ngx-skeleton-loader>
</div>
```

- Supporting enabling/disabling animations.
  Now the users will be able to enable/disable animations by using `animation` input. It's a string with `false` as value that the component receives to check if it should not load progress animation.

> It works only to disable it. In case you want to keep enable it

```js
<div class="item">
  <ngx-skeleton-loader animation="false"></ngx-skeleton-loader>
</div>
```
